# Security with HTTP API

EventStoreDB supports basic authentication for HTTP API calls and access control lists (ACL).

## Authentication

### Creating users

Many API resources require basic HTTP authentication of internal users. You create these users with the HTTP API or the admin console. For a new project, you need to use the credentials of the default user in the request, which has the username of `admin`, and the password of `changeit`.

Send the following JSON payload to the server:

```json
{
  "LoginName": "adminuser",
  "FullName": "EventStore Admin",
  "Groups": ["$admins", "DataScience"],
  "Password": "aVerySecurePassword"
}
```

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="request" label="Request">

```bash
curl -i -d "@new-user.json" "http://127.0.0.1:2113/users" \
    -H "Content-Type:application/json"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="response" label="Response">

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, X-Requested-With, X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-Prefix, X-PINGOTHER, Authorization, ES-LongPoll, ES-ExpectedVersion, ES-EventId, ES-EventType, ES-RequiresMaster, ES-HardDelete, ES-ResolveLinkTos
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

{
  "loginName": "adminuser",
  "success": true,
  "error": "Success",
  "msgTypeId": 50
}

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once you have added users, you can use their details with requests.

If you were to use the wrong user or no user when a request requires one, you receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.

```bash
curl -i 'http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/$all' -u admin:password
```

  </TabItem>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

As you pass the username and password in the request, we recommend you to enable SSL to encrypt the user information. [Read this guide for instructions](pathname:///../../../security).

## Access control lists

Alongside authentication, EventStoreDB supports per stream configuration of Access Control Lists (ACL). To configure the ACL of a stream go to its head and look for the `metadata` relationship link to fetch the metadata for the stream.

To set access control lists over HTTP you can post to the metadata stream as [with setting any other metadata](README.mdx#stream-metadata). You can also set Access Control Lists for a stream in the admin UI.

### ACL example

The ACL below gives `writer` read and write permission on the stream, while `reader` has read permission on the stream. Only users in the `$admins` group can delete the stream or read and write the metadata.

The request body placed in the file named `acl_metadata.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "eventId": "7c314750-05e1-439f-b2eb-f5b0e019be72",
    "eventType": "$acl-updated",
    "data": {
      "acl": {
        "r": ["reader", "writer"],
        "w": "writer",
        "d": "$admins",
        "mr": "$admins",
        "mw": "$admins"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

Then, when you execute HTTP request as follows:

```bash
curl -i -d @acl_metadata.json http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/metadata \
    --user admin:changeit \
    -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.eventstore.events+json"
```

You get a confirmation from the server:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, GET, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, X-Requested-With, X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-Prefix, X-PINGOTHER, Authorization, ES-LongPoll, ES-ExpectedVersion, ES-EventId, ES-EventType, ES-RequiresMaster, ES-HardDelete, ES-ResolveLinkTos
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ES-Position, ES-CurrentVersion
Location: http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/%24%24newstream/0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Server: Mono-HTTPAPI/1.0
Date: Tue, 18 Sep 2018 09:38:56 GMT
Content-Length: 0
Keep-Alive: timeout=15,max=100
```

## Default ACL

:::tip
The examples below assume you have created a user named `ouro` with password `ouroboros`.
:::

If you try to access the `$settings` stream as an unauthorized user, the server returns a 401 response.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="request" label="Request">

```bash
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/%24settings \
    -u ouro:ouroboros
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="response" label="Response">

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, DELETE, GET, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, X-Requested-With, X-PINGOTHER, Authorization, ES-LongPoll, ES-ExpectedVersion, ES-EventId, ES-EventType, ES-RequiresMaster, ES-HardDelete, ES-ResolveLinkTo, ES-ExpectedVersion
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ES-Position
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="ES"
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Server: Mono-HTTPAPI/1.0
Date: Mon, 02 Mar 2015 15:21:27 GMT
Content-Length: 0
Keep-Alive: timeout=15,max=100
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you wanted to give `ouro` access by default to system streams, save following JSON as `defaultacl.json`:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "$userStreamAcl": {
      "$r": "$all",
      "$w": "ouro",
      "$d": "ouro",
      "$mr": "ouro",
      "$mw": "ouro"
    },
    "$systemStreamAcl": {
      "$r": ["$admins", "ouro"],
      "$w": "$admins",
      "$d": "$admins",
      "$mr": "$admins",
      "$mw": "$admins"
    }
  }
}
```

Then send this JSON in a POST request to the `$settings` stream using an existing admin user's credentials.

```bash
curl -i -d "@defaultacl.json" http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/%24settings \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "ES-EventType: "$acl-updated" \
    -H "ES-EventId": "3e1ad5b2-043f-4cf6-8b84-0fe34d7a4b0c" \
    -u "admin:changeit"
```

At which point `ouro` can read system streams by default.

```bash
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/%24settings \
    -u ouro:ouroboros

<TabItem value="response" label="Response">

Content-Length: 1286
Keep-Alive: timeout=15,max=100
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can also limit ACLs on particular streams by setting the following `$acl` object in the metadata, which are then merged with the default ACLs.

```json
{
  "$acl": {
    "$r": ["reader", "also-reader"]
  }
}
```

If you add the above to a stream's ACL, then it overrides the read permission on the specified stream to allow `reader` and `also-reader` to read streams, but not `ouro`, resulting in the effective ACL below.

```json
{
  "$acl": {
    "$r": ["reader", "also-reader"],
    "$w": "ouro",
    "$d": "ouro",
    "$mr": "ouro",
    "$mw": "ouro"
  }
}
```

:::warning
Caching is allowed on a stream if you have enabled it to be visible to `$all`. This is as a performance optimization to avoid having to set `cache=private` on all data. If people are bookmarking your URIs and they were cached by an intermediary, then they may still be accessible after you change the permissions from `$all`. While clients should not be bookmarking URIs in this way, it's an important consideration.
