# EventStoreDB version 5.0 documentation

EventStoreDB is an open-source event-native database, designed to harness the true power of event-driven architecture.

This is the documentation for the deprecated version 5.0 of EventStoreDB. See the [Changes](./docs/changes.md) page for a log of differences between this version and latest versions and consider upgrading to a later, supported version of EventStoreDB for the most features and best support.
